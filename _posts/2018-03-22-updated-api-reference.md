We've updated the [API reference]({{ site.baseurl }}/api) section to provide more information about the Financials resources and their attributes exposed via the REST API. Now you can easily identify required attributes and view such information as attribute type, maximum value length in characters, possible values for picklist attributes, and default values for boolean attributes.
